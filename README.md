My attempt at creating a webpage that uses JavaScript

This is a website that utilizes functions that I created for FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.
I wanted to try out hooking up simple HTML Input/Output webpage with JavaScript functions.


# TODO:
* Add all of the project's functions (Roman Numeral Converter, Caesars Cipher, Telephone Number Validator, Cash Register)
* Improve the looks of the page
* Add descriptions and test cases for functions
